# ⚙️ Automated Data Infrastructure

### *“The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight.”* — Carly Fiorina

This repository serves as a professional portfolio for **Systems Architecture, Data Engineering, and Infrastructure Automation**. It bridges the gap between low-level Linux administration and high-level data manipulation, focusing on scalable and reproducible scientific workflows.

---

## 🎯 Professional Objective

The mission of this project is to build a robust ecosystem for data-driven research. By leveraging the power of **Python**, **Docker**, and **Linux**, I aim to automate the entire lifecycle of data—from ingestion and cleaning to deployment and monitoring—ensuring maximum efficiency for complex computational tasks.

---

## 🛠️ Core Technology Stack

- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Selenium), Bash Scripting (Automation).
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose (Environment isolation).
- **Data Management:** SQL & NoSQL integration, JSON/CSV automated processing.
- **Infrastructure:** Advanced Linux Administration (Systemd, Cron jobs, SSH tunneling).
- **Environment:** Optimized for high-performance deep work within a **bspwm** tiling window manager.

## 🚀 Key Projects & Implementations

### 1. Automated Scientific Pipelines
- **Description:** Python-based scripts designed to automate the extraction and cleaning of large datasets.
- **Tools:** `Pandas` for data wrangling and `Cron` for scheduled execution.

### 2. Containerized Research Environments
- **Description:** Dockerfiles optimized for scientific computing, ensuring that experiments (Calculus/Linear Algebra) run identically on any machine.
- **Tools:** Docker, Miniconda.

### 3. Linux System Optimization
- **Description:** A collection of Bash scripts for automated system maintenance, backup protocols, and secure remote access.
- **Tools:** Bash, `rsync`, `openssh`.
